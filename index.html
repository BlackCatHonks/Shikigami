            You're free to add me there and we can hang out. If I'm on orange status, I might be chatting with a specific group and will get back to you later.

            <h3>Twitch</h3>
            I rarely play stream games on here, but I've always been procrasting on using this more often. My favourite games to play are usually character action (Ninja Gaiden, Devil May Cry, ) and fighting games (BlazBlue, Guilty Gear, Persona 4 Arena, Golden Fantasia). I've also dumped a lot of hours into the Souls series.

          I do have one, please contact me elsewhere before adding me on here, there's too many bots out there.

          I mainly use a Chen avatar to represent myself on VRChat, Twitch, and etc...
          <div>Current model base: <i>Chocolat</i>. I've done a lot of texture and blendshape modifications to all assets used. Hair was modified by myself from the Shinano base to be short hair. The tails and eye texture were modified from the Ringo base. These all can be found on Booth.pm.</div>
          <div>Some clothing assets: <i>Nasuten Chen</i> MMD model. Things like the ears, vest are modified from the asset.</div>
          <div>Any other clothing likely modified from assets bought on Booth.pm.</div>
          <div>Any VRChat screenshots may or may not have links to their corressponding worlds, I don't always remember which I've been to.</div>
